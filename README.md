# PRODIGY_WD_02 (STOPWATCH WEB APP)
I'm delighted to share that I've accomplished Task 2 during my internship at Prodigy InfoTech. Recently, I developed a dynamic stopwatch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project provided me with a hands-on exploration of front-end development, deepening my understanding of building interactive web applications.
